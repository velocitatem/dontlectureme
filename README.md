> A program that pays attention to your lectures for you.

Paying attention to a ~3h lecture is difficult, especially with ADHD. What if, your computer does it for you?

You might be thinking, "but that defeats the purpose of even being there", yes.

## Solution ðŸ’¡
1. You study the material before (You actually have to do this) and take notes.
2. You write down what you *do not understand*, *what you want to know more about*, and *what you want to ask the professor*.
3. You go to class, and have the computer pay attention to the lecture.
4. Once the computer recognizes a word or phrase you wrote down, it will prompt you to **pay attention**/**ask a question**/**take notes**.

## How it works ðŸ§°
Write your notes/keywords into `keywords.txt`. Then you can run the program:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The program will then listen to the microphone and try to recognize the keywords. If it does, it will prompt you with a notification.

After the lecture, the program continuously saves the lecture into a database (sqlite) with the current date as the name, you can then use the sowing-kit to compile the lecture into a single file (audio and transcript):

```bash
python3 sowing-kit.py <date>.db
```

## How to install ðŸ“¥

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
